## 🧠 About Me

I'm deeply interested in the intersection of design and code — how functionality and beauty can coexist in a well-crafted interface. I enjoy turning complex ideas into intuitive, accessible, and fast experiences.

I'm always learning — whether it's a new framework, design principle, or accessibility best practice — and I bring that energy to every project I touch.
